Example 1: Linear Equations\n
Concept: Solving linear equations involves isolating the variable on one side of the equation.\n
Example: Solve for 𝑥 in 3𝑥 + 5 = 11.\n
Steps:\n
Subtract 5 from both sides: 3𝑥 = 6.\n
Divide both sides by 3: 𝑥 = 2.\n\n
Example 2: Quadratic Equations\n
Concept: Quadratic equations involve terms with 𝑥^2 and can be solved using various methods such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.\n
Example: Solve 𝑥^2 − 4𝑥 + 4 = 0.\n
Steps:\n
Factorize the equation: (𝑥 − 2)^2 = 0.\n
Take the square root of both sides: 𝑥 − 2 = 0.\n
Solve for 𝑥: 𝑥 = 2.\n\n
Example 3: Systems of Equations\n
Concept: Systems of equations involve multiple equations with multiple variables, which can be solved simultaneously.\n
Example: Solve the system 2𝑥 + 𝑦 = 7 and 𝑥 − 𝑦 = 1.\n
Steps:\n
Use substitution or elimination method:\n
From the second equation, express 𝑥 in terms of 𝑦: 𝑥 = 𝑦 + 1.\n
Substitute 𝑥 into the first equation and solve for 𝑦, then find 𝑥.\n\n
2. Geometry\n
Example 1: Area and Perimeter of Shapes\n
Concept: Calculating the area and perimeter involves different formulas depending on the shape.\n
Example: Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length 𝑙 = 4 units and width 𝑤 = 3 units.\n
Area: Area = 𝑙 × 𝑤 = 4 × 3 = 12 square units.\n
Perimeter: Perimeter = 2(𝑙 + 𝑤) = 2(4 + 3) = 14 units.\n\n
Example 2: Pythagorean Theorem\n
Concept: The Pythagorean theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.\n
Example: Given a right triangle with legs 𝑎 = 3 units and 𝑏 = 4 units, find the length of the hypotenuse 𝑐.\n
Calculation: 𝑐^2 = 𝑎^2 + 𝑏^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n
𝑐 = √25 = 5.\n\n
Example 3: Circle Properties\n
Concept: Circles have specific properties such as radius, diameter, circumference, and area.\n
Example: Find the circumference and area of a circle with radius 𝑟 = 6 units.\n
Circumference: 𝐶 = 2𝜋𝑟 = 2𝜋 × 6 = 12𝜋 units.\n
Area: 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟^2 = 𝜋 × 6^2 = 36𝜋 square units.\n\n
3. Statistics and Probability\n
Example 1: Mean, Median, and Mode\n
Concept: Measures of central tendency describe the center of a data set.\n
Example: Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the data set: 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10.\n
Mean: Mean = (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 10) / 7 = 7.57.\n
Median: Median = 8.\n
Mode: Mode = 8.\n\n
Example 2: Probability Basics\n
Concept: Probability measures the likelihood of events occurring.\n
Example: Calculate the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die.\n
Probability: 𝑃(rolling a 6) = 1/6.\n\n
Example 3: Binomial Distribution\n
Concept: The binomial distribution describes the probability of a given number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.\n
Example: Compute the probability of getting exactly 2 heads in 3 flips of a fair coin.\n
Formula: 𝑃(𝑋 = 𝑘) = (𝑛 𝑘) 𝑝^𝑘 (1 − 𝑝)^(𝑛 − 𝑘).\n
Calculation: 𝑃(𝑋 = 2) = (3 2) (0.5)^2 (0.5)^1 = 3 × 0.25 × 0.5 = 0.375.\n\n
4. Functions\n
Example 1: Linear Functions\n
Concept: Linear functions have the form 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑏, where 𝑚 is the slope and 𝑏 is the y-intercept.\n
Example: Determine if the function 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 + 3 is increasing or decreasing.\n
Analysis: The slope 𝑚 = 2 is positive, indicating the function is increasing.\n\n
Example 2: Quadratic Functions\n
Concept: Quadratic functions have the form 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐, where 𝑎 ≠ 0.\n
Example: Find the vertex (maximum/minimum point) of the function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥^2 − 4𝑥 + 3.\n
Vertex: Use the formula 𝑥 = −𝑏/2𝑎 to find 𝑥: 𝑥 = 2.\n
Evaluate 𝑓(2) to find 𝑦: 𝑓(2) = −1.\n
Vertex: (2, −1) is the minimum point.\n\n
Example 3: Exponential Functions\n
Concept: Exponential functions have the form 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎 ⋅ 𝑏^𝑥, where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are constants with 𝑏 > 0 and 𝑏 ≠ 1.\n
Example: Calculate the value of 𝑓(3) for the function 𝑓(𝑥) = 2 ⋅ 3^𝑥.\n
Calculation: 𝑓(3) = 54.\n\n
5. Trigonometry\n
Example 1: Trigonometric Functions\n
Concept: Trigonometric functions such as sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) relate angles to sides of a triangle.\n
Example: Find the value of sin(30°) and cos(45°).\n
Calculation: sin(30°) = 1/2 and cos(45°) = √2 / 2.\n\n
Example 2: Trigonometric Identities\n
Concept: Trigonometric identities are equalities involving trigonometric functions that are true for all values of the variables.\n
Example: Verify the identity sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1 for any angle θ.\n\n
Example 3: Solving Triangles\n
Concept: Solving triangles involves using trigonometric ratios to find missing sides and angles.\n
Example: Given △ABC with ∠A = 30°, ∠B = 60°, and side 𝑐 = 10 units, find side 𝑎.\n\n
6. Calculus\n
Example 1: Derivatives\n
Concept: Derivatives represent the rate of change of a function.\n
Example: Find the derivative of 𝑓(𝑥) = 3𝑥^2 + 2𝑥 − 1.\n
Calculation: 𝑓'(𝑥) = 6𝑥 + 2.\n\n
Example 2: Integration\n
Concept: Integration computes the area under a curve.\n
Example: Compute ∫(2𝑥 + 1) dx = 𝑥^2 + 𝑥 + 𝐶, where 𝐶 is the constant of integration.\n\n
Example 3: Applications of Derivatives\n
Concept: Derivatives have practical applications in optimization and physics.\n
Example: Maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter 𝑃.
